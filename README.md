The Index is a simple Hacker News reader app which is focused on making you read less, by only showing you the top stories of the last 24 hours.

## Contributing

I'm always looking for contributions to make this app a bit better, and eventually launch it on the Play Store & App Store! Check out the github issues for things you can help with.

## Developing

This app works on both iOS and Android. To start working on it locally, you can follow these steps:
1. Install Flutter
1. Clone the project
1. Restore Flutter dependencies
1. `flutter run`, select your device and go!
